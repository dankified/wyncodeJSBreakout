# Not a lot of fun with functions :(

## Today we will be building functions! and array iterators and more functions! Remember the rules, you are allowed to work in groups, google whatever and ask me and other instructors for assistance.

### Build:
1. A factory function that takes 3 **parameters**: firstName, lastName, age. This function will **return** an **object** with 2 **properties**: fullName and age. fullName will be the result of concatenating firstName and lastName. (**Diff 2**) 
**Bonus**: Format the firstName and lastName correctly (**e.g**:  'mAria' should be formatted to 'Maria')

2. A function that goes through each element of an **array** of **strings** and **console.log()** each element that starts with  the letter **'o'** be it upper case or lower case. (**Diff 2**)

3. A function that takes 3 **arguments**. The first **argument** is going to be an **array** the second **argument** will be **any type of data** and the third **argument** will be a **number**.  This function will insert the second argument into the first argument at the index specified by the third argument. Sounds more complicated than it is. (**Diff 3**)

4. A function that goes through each element of a **numbers** **array** and creates a new **array** that contains the **number** multiplied by 2 (**Diff 1**)

5. A function that finds the average value of all elements in an array. Be sure to round the result to 2 decimal values. (**Diff 2**)
