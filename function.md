# Fun with Functions
## We will be creating multiple functions isn this session. You guys have about an hour and a half to finish as many of these as you can. 

## Each problem will have  a difficulty level ranging from 1 to 5, 5 being the hardest difficulty 

## Afterwards I'll build the ones that you guys want. As always, you are allowed to work in groups and to ask me and the other instructor for hints. Have fun!


**Build**
1. function that returns the sum of 2 numbers. (Diff: 1)
2. function that takes a number as an argument and returns ```true``` if the number is even or else it will return ```false```(Diff: 2)
3. function that takes a number argument and returns a random number between 1 and the argument passed to it. (Diff: 3)
4. function that takes a string argument and returns the capitalized version of that string (Diff: 1)
5. function that takes an indefinite amount of string arguments and will return an array containing all arguments that have a length property greater than 10. (Diff: 4)
6. function that takes an indefinite amount of number arguments and will return the largest number among all the arguments. (Diff: 5)
7. function that takes multiple arguments and will return the sum of all arguments that are odd (Diff: 5).
8. function that takes 3 arguments as either string or numbers and will return the numeric sum of the 3 arguments. tip: Coerce the values to number. (Diff: 3)

#### Bonus: Validate the data types of your arguments!
